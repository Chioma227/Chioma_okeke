#steps 

-Planning and Requirement Gathering:

With clients, designers, and potential back-end developers, I collaborate to understand the project goals, target audience, and functionalities.
reviewing wireframes or mockups, and clarify technical details.

- Development:

I'll translate design assets and functionalities into code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework like React.
This stage involves building reusable components, structuring website layouts, and implementing interactive elements.

- Responsiveness and Cross-Browser Compatibility:

In this step, I'll ensure the website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet) for optimal user experience across devices.
I'll also test the website's functionality and appearance across various web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to guarantee consistent performance.

-Deployment:

Once testing is complete, I'll work with the team to deploy the website to a web hosting platform, making it accessible to the public.
This might involve configuration settings and launch procedures specific to the chosen hosting provider.

- Maintenance and Updates:

Depending on the project agreement, I could be involved in the website's maintenance, fixing bugs, implementing new features, or updating content as needed.
